# Theta Health MCP Server

> Connect your Health Data to Cursor, Claude, Cherry Studio, Windsurf, and other AI assistants.

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) standardizes how Large Language Models (LLMs) talk to external services like Theta Health. It connects AI assistants directly with your Theta Health project and allows them to perform tasks like managing tables, fetching config, and querying data. See the [full list of tools](#tools).

## Setup

Configure your MCP client (such as `Cursor` / `Cherry Studio`) to use this server. Most MCP clients store the configuration as JSON in the following format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "theta_health_mcp": {
      "url": "https://mcp.thetahealth.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

You will need to login in with `oauth2.0` for the first time.

If you have `npx` tool in your runtime, you can also use this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "theta_health_mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "theta_health_mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
